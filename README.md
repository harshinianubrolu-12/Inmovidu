In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, provided in a CSV file. The initial step involved data cleaning, where I removed null values and discarded irrelevant columns to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

I then conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, performing both univariate and bivariate analyses. To better understand the data and reduce dimensionality, I used correlation-based techniques.

Next, I applied several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing. After training the models, I evaluated their performance to identify the algorithm that provided the highest accuracy.

The project utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation.
